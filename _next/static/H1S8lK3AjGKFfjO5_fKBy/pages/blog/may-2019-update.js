We have accepted 206 commits from 78 different contributors. We have changed 3,031 files with 96,616 additions and 85,768 deletions.\n\n## Our roadmap intent for June\n\n*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*\n\n- We will release an improved Slider component with range support. You can already [preview it](https://deploy-preview-15703--material-ui.netlify.com/components/slider/).\n\n![Slider](/static/blog/may-2019-update/slider.png)\n\n- We will work on a new Tree View component. You can already [preview it](https://deploy-preview-14827--material-ui.netlify.com/components/tree-view/).\n\n![Tree View](/static/blog/may-2019-update/tree-view.png)\n\n- We will add more themes to the [premium theme marketplace](https://themes.material-ui.com/).\n- We will start exploring how we can provide style adapters in v5 (styled-components, JSS, linaria, naked, etc.)\n- We will experiment around advisory offerings for enterprises.\nIf you are an enterprise and are looking for one of the following:\n  - A dedicated communication channel giving priority access to Material-UI engineers.\n  - Architecture Reviews. Sit down with a Material-UI engineer and walk through all aspects of your Material-UI project and current tech stack or architecture, to identify issues and opportunities for improvement.\n\nYou can contact us at advisory@material-ui.com.\n\n<hr />\n\nMaterial-UI is an MIT-licensed open source project. It‚Äôs an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the support of these awesome [backers](/discover-more/backers/).
