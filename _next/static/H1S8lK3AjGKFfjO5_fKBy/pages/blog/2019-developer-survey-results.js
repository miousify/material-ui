To refine our focus, we launched a developer survey last month,\nto which we received 734 contributions. Thank you for your participation!\nThe survey is now closed and this is a summary of the results.\n\nThe survey was broken into three sections, "Introduction", "About you" and "Your product".\n\n## Introduction\n\nHere we asked for the good, the bad and the ugly. Thankfully, it\'s mostly good, but we can focus\non the things that will make it even better.\n\n### 1. How would you feel if you could no longer use Material-UI?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/1.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Pie chart: 74.7% Very disappointed, 18.9% disappointed, 6.4% not disappointed." />\n\nAn overwhelming majority of respondents (over 93%), would be disappointed or very disappointed if\nthey could no longer use Material-UI. The benchmark for "very disappointed" is 40%,\nso we\'re on the right track. Don\'t worry, Material-UI isn\'t going away any time soon ‚Äì\nwe want to focus on making even more of you "very disappointed", as it were!\n\nCuriously, the 6.4% who said they would _not_ be disappointed if they could no longer use\nMaterial-UI collectively gave a Net Promoter Score of 68%, which is\n[higher than that of all respondents as a whole](#5-how-likely-is-it-that-you-would-recommend-material-ui-to-a-friend-or-colleague),\nso we know they love us really. üòò\n\n### 2. Who do you think would most benefit from Material-UI?\n\nThis word cloud was generated with [wordclouds.com](https://wordclouds.com).\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/2.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Word cloud of who would benefit most" />\n\nDevelopers, developers, developers! (And "anyone" and "everyone", apparently! ) This is understandable, given the\n[job role demographic](#7-which-of-the-following-best-describes-your-current-job-role)\nof the majority of respondents. We\'ll continue to work on the developer experience, making it\neasier to get started with, use, and customize Material-UI.\n\n### 3. What is the main benefit you receive from Material-UI?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/3.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Word cloud of the main benefit of Material-UI" />\n\nThe responses variously commented on being able to focus on the business logic, time saved,\ngood looking components, ease of use, design consistency, good documentation.\nWe\'ll make sure that we continue to do more of the things that benefit you the most.\n\n### 4. How can we improve Material-UI for you?\n\nWe have grouped the answers into different categories.\nThe prefix corresponds to the number of times the concern was mentioned.\nIt‚Äôs sorted descending, with the most important concerns first:\n\n- 135 **More components:**\n  - 56 Non-specific\n  - 21 Date picker\n  - 10 Autocomplete\n  - 9 Layout\n  - 8 Table++\n  - 5 Carousel\n  - 5 Slider\n  - 3 Video\n  - 2 Calendar\n  - 2 Menu nesting\n  - 2 List - draggable\n  - 1 Tree view\n  - 1 Color picker\n  - 1 Dense mode\n  - 1 For landing pages\n  - 1 Group avatar\n  - 1 Image gallery\n  - 1 Image picker\n  - 1 Menu - dropdown\n  - 1 Mobile\n  - 1 Rating\n  - 1 Timeline\n  - 1 Transfer\n\n- 50 **Better customization:**\n  - 23 Non-specific\n  - 15 Docs\n  - 8 Easier\n  - 3 Theme\n  - 1 Colors\n\n- 36 **Better documentation:**\n  - 11 Non-specific\n  - 7 More examples\n  - 5 Beginner tutorials\n  - 4 Video lessons\n  - 2 API pages\n  - 2 Icon explorer\n  - 1 Best practices\n  - 1 Customization\n  - 1 Global CSS\n  - 1 Demo source scroll issue\n  - 1 Server-side rendering\n\n- 31 **TypeScript:**\n  - 14 Non-specific\n  - 13 Migrate more demos\n  - 3 withStyles -> makeStyles\n  - 1 Rewrite\n\n- 24 **Performance:**\n  - 23 Non-specific\n  - 1 Table\n\n- 19 **Bundle size**\n- 17 **Material Design Update**\n- 16 **styled-components:**\n  - 10 Support\n  - 6 Migration\n\n- 14 **Fewer breaking changes**\n- 10 **More page layout examples**\n- 9 **Theme:**\n  - 3 More colors\n  - 3 Live editor\n  - 1 Non-material font example\n  - 2 Responsive typography\n\n- 8 **React.StrictMode support**\n- 8 **React Native support**\n- 6 **Accessibility:**\n  - 4 Non specific\n  - 1 Docs\n  - 1 SkipNav\n\n- 6 **Hooks at 100%**\n- 4 **Animations**\n- 4 **Long Term Support**\n- 4 **Simplification**\n- 3 **Gatsby plugin**\n- 3 **i18n**\n- 3 **Premium themes**\n- 3 **Showcase, design inspiration**\n- 2 **Clear Roadmap**\n- 2 **Preact support**\n- 2 **Simpler: closer to DOM nodes**\n- 2 **Styleless components**\n- 1 **Web component integration example**\n- 1 **Collect user feedback**\n- 1 **Non-Material Design theme example**\n- 1 **Right to left**\n- 1 **Storybook addons**\n- 1 **Styles: better docs**\n- 1 **Testing**\n\n### 5. How likely is it that you would recommend Material-UI to a friend or colleague?\n\n<figure style="margin-inline-start: 0;">\n  <img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/5a.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart of raw data" />\n  <figcaption style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Raw data.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br />\n<figure style="margin-inline-start: 0;">\n<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="/static/blog/2019-survey/5b.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Pie chart: 70.6% promoters, 24.8% neutrals, 4.6% detractors" />\n  <figcaption style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Result.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nDevelopers gave Material-UI a [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)\n(promoters less detractors) of 66%. Given the NPS range of -100 to +100, a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù score or NPS\nabove 0 is considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù, +50 is ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù, and above 70 is considered ‚Äúworld class.‚Äù\n\n## About you\n\n### 6. How did you hear about Material-UI?\n\nMultiple options were allowed.\n\n| Channel(s) | Number |\n|-----|-----|\n| Search | 344 |\n| Word of mouth | 112 |\n| Search, Word of mouth | 47 |\n| Search, Social | 25 |\n| Social | 22 |\n| Blog | 14 |\n| Search, Word of mouth, Blog | 11 |\n\n<br /><br />\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/6.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 74.3% search, 29.6% word of mouth, 8.2% Social, 4.3% blog." />\n\n### 7. Which of the following best describes your current job role?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/7.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 358 Full-stack developers, 189 Frontend developers, 103 Entrepreneurs, 31 Beginners, 42 Other" />\n\nNo huge surprises here!\n\n### 8. How big is your organization?\n\n<img  src="/static/blog/2019-survey/8.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 61 Hobby, 98 Self-employed, 181 x 2-10, 167 x 11-50, 126 x 51-500, 89 x 500 +" />\n\nMaterial-UI is most popular with small to medium sized organisations,\nperhaps because beyond a certain size, organizations have teams building their own design system and framework.\nWe want to continue to make it easy to use the component logic of Material-UI while allowing\ndesigners to give it a bespoke look and feel for their organization.\n\n### 9. How long have you been developing with JavaScript\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/9.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 26 x I\'m just getting started!, 43 x 6 months +, 150 x 1 year +, 179 x 3 years +, 155 x 5 years, 82 x 10 years +, 47 x 15 years +" />\n\nA nice bell curve, with the majority of developers having 1 to 5 years experience with Javascript.\n\n### 10. How long have you been developing with React?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/10.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 99\tx I\'m just getting started!, 77\tx 6 months +, 301 x 1 year +, 171 x 3 years +, 32 x 5 years - bleeding edge baby!" />\n\n### 11. How long have you been developing with Material-UI?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/11.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 160\tx I\'m just getting started!, 147\tx 6 months +, 293\tx 1 year +, 71 x 3 years +, 11 x Four years + ‚Äì I\'m a pioneer!" />\n\nWe missed a trick by not including "2 years +" here, so "1 year +" looks stacked.\nThe number of users of Material-UI continues to grow at a steady pace, and once on board, many\ndevelopers stick with it.\n\n### 12. What were you primarily using before Material-UI?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/12.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 55% Bootstrap, 18% Custom, 12% Other, 7% Semantic-IU, 6% Materialize, 3% React Toolbox" />\n\nGiven its relative popularity, and the move from CSS / HTML / jQuery towards front-end frameworks,\nit should come as no big surprise to see that the majority of respondents were previously using Bootstrap.\nCustom solutions have also been replaced by Material-UI as your go-to UI library, along with a\nlong-tail of other frameworks.\n\n\n### 13. How many Material-UI based projects have you built?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/13.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Pie chart: 10.7% I\'m just getting started, 23.5% 1, 52.5% 2-5, 11.1% 6-10, 2.2% 10+" />\n\nOver three quarters of you have built two or more projects with Material-UI, with 13.3% having six\nor more projects under your belt. The 2.2% with ten or more, we salute you!\n\n## Your product\n\n### 14. What are you building?\n\nMultiple options were allowed.\n\n- Dashboard & admin: 70%\n- UI components (design system): 40%\n- Business & corporate pages: 35%\n- Landing pages (product): 33%\n- e-commerce: 14%\n- Portfolio & resume: 12%\n- Blog: 8%\n\nDashboards are at the top of the heap, and we\'ve long known that many of you are building internal\nsystems that can\'t feature in [the showcase](/discover-more/showcase/). Let us know by opening a PR\nif you\'re bucking that trend, and have something sparkly to share! And if you\'re in the 40% building UI\ncomponents, we\'d be happy to give you a shout out in the [related projects](/discover-more/related-projects/)\nsection.\n\n### 15. What ‚Äúdelivery mechanism‚Äù are you using?\n\nMultiple options were allowed.\n\n- Web app (e.g. create react app): 92%\n- Progressive web app (with service worker): 25%\n- Server-side rendering 14%\n- Static web site, hosted on a CDN (e.g. Gatsby): 13%\n- Desktop app (e.g. Electron): 12%\n- Native mobile app (e.g. Cordova): 6%\n\n### 16. Who are you building it for?\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/16.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Pie chart: 54,3% for my company, 24.9% for a client, 15.2% as a side project, 5.6% more than one of these." />\n\n### 17. Which JS framework are you using, if any?\n\nMultiple options were allowed.\n\n- Create React App: 75%\n- none: 17%\n- Next.js: 12%\n- Gatsby: 8%\n\nServer-side rendering isn\'t yet very popular.\nAs the React ecosystem matures, we might see a [big](https://www.rank2traffic.com/gatsbyjs.org) [push](https://www.rank2traffic.com/nextjs.org) of server-side rendering in the coming months.\n\n### 18. What styling system are you using?\n\nMultiple options were allowed.\n\n- @material-ui/styles: 85%\n- Styled components: 30%\n- Good old CSS (+sass, less, etc): 24%\n- CSS Modules (+sass, less, etc): 16%\n- Emotion: 4%\n\nTraditional CSS users are still prevalent (24% + 16%).\nThe components customization `classes` API was designed for these people.\nIt\'s also why we allow the generation of deterministic class names (*MuiButton-root* instead of *jss113*).\n\nHowever, styled components is popular. We will work on better supporting it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis data is **incredibly valuable** for our team.\nAgain, thank you for participating!\nWe want to work on the problems that resonate the most with our users.\n[It\'s clear](#4-how-can-we-improve-material-ui-for-you) that we should:\n\n1. Support more components\n2. Improve the customization\n3. Improve the documentation\n4. Improve the static typings\n5. Reduce the overhead of the library\n\n**We will update [our ROADMAP](/discover-more/roadmap/) in the coming days**.\nWe will run a similar survey next year to keep track of our progress.\n\nIf you want to continue to influence our roadmap, please upvote üëç the issues you are the most interested in on GitHub.\n\n<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/vote.gif" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="How to upvote on GitHub" />\n<div style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin: 8px;">Help us prioritize by upvoting.</div>\n\n<hr />\n\nMaterial-UI is an MIT-licensed open source project.
